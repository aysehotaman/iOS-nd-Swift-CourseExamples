## About The Project

After making some progress in the course, I wanted to make an app to reinforce what I learned. I recently watched the Howl's Moving Castle and I loved it.
So idea of making a simple app that introduces the characters came to my mind. 
If you want to make a suggestion anything about the app you can always submit a pull request. 

## Features
